A bundle of gems for a sonar-connector installation.

INSTALLATION

JRuby and bundler cannot be used for installation of the bundle due to a bug in JRuby regarding tar files.
Therefore, we install the bundle using system ruby, bodge the installation to work with JRuby, 
and run the connector using JRuby. 

1. Use native system ruby (or RVM) and bundler gem to install bundle

Check that you have the bundler gem

$ gem list bundler

*** LOCAL GEMS ***
bundler (1.0.0)

2. Install bundle
./script/bundle_install

3. Perform magic

>insert bodge here<

4. Create a config file

cp config/config.json.example config/config.json

Edit config file accordingly.

5. Start the connector

./script/start
